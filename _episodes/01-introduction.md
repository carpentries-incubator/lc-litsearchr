## Introduction

This Library Carpentry lesson introduces librarians and researchers to the R programming language, R Studio and the R package litsearchr. The lesson is intended for librarians and researchers involved in, supporting or intending to carry out systematic reviews, scoping reviews and other forms of evidence synthesis that require comprehensive Boolean search strategies. Learners need not have any coding experience or experience with R or R Studio. 

## Why R?

R is a powerful open source tool for statistical analysis, data cleaning and wrangling, data visualization and the automation of repetitive tasks. For librarians and researchers involved in supporting or conducting evidence synthesis, R and the R package litsearchr can be used to facilitate term harvesting and automate the construction of Boolean searches, a task that can otherwise be lengthy and tedious. 

Another advantage of using a programming tool like R is that it lends itself to reproducibility, such that lines of R code can be saved, shared and reused to repeat and reproduce one's work. Reproducibility and transparency of methods are key concepts underlying the strength of high quality systematic reviews and other types of evidence synthesis. 

In this lesson, learners will be introduced to R syntax (i.e., the set of rules dictating the correct structure and format of R code). And we will use R Studio, a popular platform used to develop and execute R code. 

## Why litsearchr?

To learn any new tool or skill, it is best to put that skill to use in a practical way. Thus, we've developed this lesson around the R package litsearchr for use in the context of developing comprehensive search strategies for evidence synthesis. Learners will use the bibliographic data from a citation file to identify additional keywords and build Boolean searches using R code.

>## Breakout Room and Zoom Set-up
>
>We'll use this time to move into Zoom breakout rooms and do the following: 
>1. Round of introductions
>2. Test using [the Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/litsearchr-alpha-202309) 
>3. Test Zoom functions including muting/unmuting, Yes/No feature, screen sharing, and remote screen control
>4. Check that everyone has an appropriate screen and window set up to view Zoom and RStudio, and to access the Etherpad when needed.
>5. Check that everyone has R and RStudio installed.
>6. Review use of Yes/No feature, Zoom chat and breakout rooms for asking questions and getting help
