This Library Carpentry lesson introduces people working in library- and information-related roles to using R and Rstudio when working on systematic reviews. In addition to the basics of R and RStudio, you will learn to use the litsearchr R package. 

`litsearchr` facilitates the development of a systematic search strategy, partially automating keyword selection from a set of search results and writing Boolean searches, including automating truncation of terms. 

This is an introduction to R and RStudio designed for participants with no programming experience. At the conclusion of the lesson you will understand what R and RStudio does and how to use the litsearchr package to advance your work with systematic reviews.

> ## Getting Started
>
> Library Carpentryâ€™s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. 
> Our lessons focus on building software and data skills within library and information-related communities. 
> To most effectively participate in the lesson, please make sure to download the data and necessary software beforehand.
> 
> 
> This workshop assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the lesson.
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lc-litsearchr/setup.html) tab to
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.
